# Introduction

The challenge of identifying students who will succeed in university settings has long been a critical concern for admission officers. While traditional metrics such as high school grades and standardized test scores have been the cornerstone of admission decisions, there is growing recognition that non-academic factors may also play a significant role in predicting academic success. This study examines the relationship between university academic performance and three potential predictive factors: high school GPA, SAT scores, and participation in extracurricular activities. Using a sample of 100 fourth-year university students, we employ linear regression analysis to evaluate the predictive power of these variables on university academic success, as measured by GPA during the first three years of university study.

# Literature Review

The prediction of academic success in higher education has been extensively studied in educational research. Traditionally, high school GPA has been considered one of the most reliable predictors of college success (Geiser & Santelices, 2007). Studies consistently show that high school GPA maintains a strong correlation with college performance, potentially due to its ability to capture both cognitive abilities and non-cognitive factors such as motivation and study habits.

Standardized testing, particularly the SAT, has also been a significant component in admission decisions. Research by the College Board (2019) demonstrates moderate to strong correlations between SAT scores and first-year college GPA. However, some studies suggest that the predictive validity of SAT scores may vary across different student populations and institutional contexts (Sackett & Kuncel, 2018).

More recently, attention has turned to the role of extracurricular activities in predicting academic success. Studies by Marsh & Kleitman (2002) found that participation in extracurricular activities was positively associated with academic achievement, potentially due to the development of time management skills, leadership capabilities, and social capital. However, the relationship between extracurricular involvement and academic performance is complex, with some research suggesting a curvilinear relationship where excessive involvement may detract from academic achievement (Frederick & Eccles, 2006).

This study contributes to the existing literature by simultaneously examining these three factors – high school GPA, SAT scores, and extracurricular activities – to determine their relative importance in predicting university academic success. The findings will be particularly valuable for admission officers seeking to develop more comprehensive and evidence-based admission criteria.

### Descriptive Statistics

The sample consisted of 100 fourth-year university students. The mean university GPA for the first three years was 7.28 (SD = 2.37) on a 12-point scale. Students in the sample had entered university with a mean high school GPA of 7.98 (SD = 2.05), also on a 12-point scale. The average SAT score was 1,083 (SD = 144) out of a possible 1,600 points. Regarding extracurricular involvement, students reported spending an average of 4.8 hours per week (SD = 3.3) on organized activities during their last year of high school.

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for all variables included in the analysis.

      all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"

```

*Note.* GPA = Grade Point Average; SAT = Scholastic Assessment Test. GPA is measured on a 12-point scale. SAT scores range from 400 to 1,600. Extracurricular activities represent average hours per week spent in organized activities during the final year of high school.

### Correlation Analysis

Analysis of the relationships between variables revealed several notable patterns. High school GPA showed a moderate positive correlation with university GPA (r = .53, p \< .05), suggesting that students who performed well in high school tended to maintain similar performance levels in university. Extracurricular activities demonstrated a weak positive correlation with both university GPA (r = .12) and high school GPA (r = .13), though these relationships were not statistically significant.

Interestingly, SAT scores showed virtually no correlation with university GPA (r = .02) and a weak negative correlation with high school GPA (r = -.10). There was also a weak negative correlation between SAT scores and extracurricular activities (r = -.17).

## Regression Analysis

set.seed(123)
data_split <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

predictions <- predict(lm_fit, test_data) |>
  bind_cols(test_data)

test_metrics <- metrics(predictions, 
                       truth = Univ_GPA,
                       estimate = .pred) |>
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)
```

A multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict university GPA based on high school GPA, SAT scores, and extracurricular activities. The overall model was statistically significant, F(3, 76) = 11.45, p \< .001, explaining 17% of the variance in university GPA (R² = .17).

```{r}
model_results |> kbl() |> kable_styling()
```

High school GPA emerged as the only significant predictor of university GPA (β = 1.27, SE = 0.23, p \< .001). Neither SAT scores (β = 0.16, SE = 0.23, p = .48) nor extracurricular activities (β = 0.30, SE = 0.23, p = .20) were significant predictors of university performance. The model can be expressed as:

University GPA = 7.50 + 1.27(HS_GPA) + 0.16(SAT) + 0.30(Activities)

```{r}
model_metrics |> t() |> kbl() |> kable_styling()
```

The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated using a test set, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.15 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.84. These error metrics, combined with the visualization of actual versus predicted values (see Figure 1), suggest moderate predictive capability with some deviation from perfect prediction.

  ) +

```

[Figure shows a scatter plot with actual GPA on the x-axis and predicted GPA on the y-axis, with points showing moderate dispersion around the diagonal line of perfect prediction]

The model diagnostics (AIC = 344.99, BIC = 356.90) and the visualization of predicted versus actual values indicate that while the model captures some meaningful relationships, there may be additional factors influencing university academic performance that are not captured in the current model.

These findings suggest that while high school GPA remains a reliable predictor of university success, the predictive power of SAT scores and extracurricular activities may be more limited than previously assumed in this context. Admission officers might consider weighing high school GPA more heavily in their admission decisions, while potentially reconsidering the emphasis placed on SAT scores and extracurricular activities as predictors of academic success.

# Conclusion

This study investigated the predictive relationships between traditional and non-traditional admission criteria and academic success at the university level. The findings yield several important implications for university admission policies and practices.

The analysis revealed that high school GPA stands as the most robust predictor of university academic performance, showing a significant positive relationship with university GPA. This finding aligns with previous research suggesting that high school academic performance remains a reliable indicator of future academic success. However, our model explained only 17% of the variance in university GPA, indicating that academic success in higher education is a complex phenomenon that cannot be fully predicted by the variables considered in this study.

Surprisingly, SAT scores showed no significant relationship with university GPA, challenging the traditional emphasis placed on standardized testing in admission decisions. This finding contributes to the ongoing debate about the value of standardized testing in predicting academic success and supports the growing trend among universities to adopt test-optional policies.

Similarly, the hours spent in extracurricular activities, while showing a positive trend, did not emerge as a statistically significant predictor of university performance. This suggests that while extracurricular involvement may contribute to student development in other important ways, its direct impact on academic performance may be limited or more complex than initially hypothesized.
